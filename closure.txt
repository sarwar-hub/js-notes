// closure
when a function is defined inside of another function, the accassing ability will be create betweent two functions variables. inside function can access the outside functions variable. its called closure.



// exmaple
function mainCounter() {
	const count = 0;
	return function(){
		return count++; // can access outer variable
	}
}



mainCounter() // it will show an anonymus function
const counter1 = mainCounter() // now counter1 containing inner function
const counter2 = mainCounter() // can define many function using 'mainCounter()' as that

counter1() // now it will show inner functions return value and each made functions output will be separate.
